HSV for Web
===========

The Web operates on RGB, HSV is much more intuitive and useful for controlling color.

Want to darken your RGB color? You need to shift two or three values. Want to shift your hue but maintain the same shade? Good luck!

HSV or HSB allows you to shift your colors easily, separating Hue, Saturation, and Value (or Balance). It's great for data visualizations and artwork. 

- This demo allows you to scale these attributes of color and view the results. 
- The simple javascript utilizes a function to shift values from HSV to web-ready RGB.
